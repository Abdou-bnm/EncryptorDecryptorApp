# AES Encryptor/Decryptor

## Project Overview
The AES Encryptor/Decryptor is a Python-based application that provides users with the ability to securely encrypt and decrypt text using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key. This tool is designed to demonstrate the principles of cryptographic security and can be used for educational purposes or for securing sensitive information in personal projects.

### Features
- **AES-256 Encryption:** Utilizes the highly secure AES-256 encryption standard to ensure robust security.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A user-friendly interface that makes it easy to encrypt and decrypt messages without needing to handle complex commands or configurations.
- **Key Management:** Generates, saves, and loads encryption keys, allowing users to manage their security keys effectively.
- **Persistence of Encrypted Messages:** Provides functionality to save and retrieve encrypted messages, making it convenient to handle data securely over time.

## Installation
To set up the AES Encryptor/Decryptor on your system, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed on your machine.
- `pip` should be installed to manage Python packages.
